CODE 201 DAY 6

I learned-----

app.js file is dependant on tests.js file so it needs to be below it on the html page on atom.
*order is really important!

"TDD"- tester driven development
"BDD"- behavior driven developmet

accessing DOM:

var myFavoriteUL = documnent.geElementById('Stuff');
myFavoriteUL.textContent = 'OMG WHAT IS THIS WIZARDRY?!?!?'
"OMG WHAT IS THIS WIZARDRY?!?!?"

move this innto javascript- copy/paste

reassigning property or access to see whats in the property.
