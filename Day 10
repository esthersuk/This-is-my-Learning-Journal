Today, I learned how to wireframe and use placehold.it for placeholders.
These are the basic steps for wireframming:
1) Build out HTML
2) Build out CSS
   A.Layout
   B.Style
3) Add content

I also learned some handy coding-

//prevent empty fields
if(!theStoreLocations || !yourMinCustomersEachHour ||
 !yourMaxCustomersEachHours || ! yourAvgCookiesPerHour) {
return alert('All fields must have a value.You had one job')
}
// validate by type
if (typeof minCustomersPerHour !== 'number') {
 return alert('Min customers must be a number');
}
