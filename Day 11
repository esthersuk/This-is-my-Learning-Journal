Week 3!
I learned about abstraction which is a big topic in computer science. I never thought of Javascript as a an abstraction of a low-level language like C or Java or that each step is called an "abstraction layer."
I also learned that these abstractions are just interfaces which are used for the USER by using data and logic. Sweet deal.
