Today I learned about Javascript flow and the order of events in code. 
These are my notes:
What happens when we open the page in the browser?
Browser reads HTML
Loads JS 
1) Take stock of vsrs + function declarations + load into menu
2) Run executable code

after SUBMIT,
event is triggered
listener hears event
grab data from form
create new instance
add new store to the allStores array
allStores.push(this);

I also learned a few debugging tips and little CSS things by browsing through Stack Overflow.
