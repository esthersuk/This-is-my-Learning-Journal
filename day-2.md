#Learning Journal: Day 2

Today, I learned how to connect Git and GitHub and how to start a file on GitHub and clone it to Git so that I can work on it on Atom.
I also learned various Git commands such as "git, push, origin, master" and a whole lot of JavaScript terminology such as MVC Architecture and S.O.C.
Good stuff!
